# Project Vision
Since the rise of mobile phone, people across all ages have been captivated by games reminisce to the arcade era: simplistic, high score-based games that did not require much thought. Something to occupy their mind  while on the commute or waiting for someone. Our product projectWarioWare (Working Title), is a video game that aims to capture that particular audience base. Our game is very much similar to the Nintendo classic: “WarioWare”, which is a collection of “microgames” played in rapid succession. These games provide a very simplistic control scheme that anyone can understand within minutes of playing. The challenge of the game is made by quickly determining the context of the controls in a short game, within an even shorter time limit. This adds to the replay ability  factor when wanting to master and achieve a high score. Unlike other arcade games, our games provide many different minigames, preventing quick burnout from repetition of the same exact task. By constantly having different prompts, the player will remain engaged in order to preform well. Additionally, the arcade nature of our game has the added benefit of not forcing players to commit time. It can be turned off and back on again without disturbing a story beat.
